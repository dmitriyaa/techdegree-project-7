# Interactive Video Player
## Treehouse Techdegree Project 7
One of 12 **_Front End Web Development_** projects at [Treehouse Techdegree Courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development)

## Project Desription
In this project, I built an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API.

Using the supplied mockups, video files, and transcript, I built an interactive video player that synchronizes the video and the transcript.

The transcript highlights as the video progresses.

When a user clicks any part of the transcript it takes them to the appropriate place in the video.
